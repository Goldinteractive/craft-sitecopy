## Using the Site Copy X plugin

### Copy entry to another site

When editing an entry in the sidebar on the right you will find a toggle to enable
site syncing. From there select the site that you want to overwrite with the currently
visible content and then just save the entry like normal. Any content of the current
site will be automatically copied to the selected site.

It's even possible to copy the current entry to multiple sites. 

As the copy will trigger a queue job, the changes might be not be reflected instantaneously in the other sites. 

***Attention:*** This action will OVERWRITE all content from the selected site.
